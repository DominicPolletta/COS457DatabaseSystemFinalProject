# COS457DatabaseSystemFinalProject

Final Project for COS457: Database Systems. Our assignment was to model a real-life scenario in an Oracle Database system. The contents of this repository contains the SQL scripts used to build the model, the ER diagram representing the system, as well as the presentation that was presented as a conclusion to the project.

My scenario was a libary database, and included the basic necessities for such a system.
